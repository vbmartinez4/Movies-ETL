# Movies-ETL

## Overview / Purpose
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming prime movies and TVs shows on Amazing Prime, the worldâ€™s largest online retailer. They are looking to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies that are released that will become a hit with their audience so they can purchase its streaming rights. The firm has created a hackathon to that gather different participants to data wrangling and utilize methods to provide a clean data set to predict the popular pictures. 

We will be assisting the video team for Amazing Prime with creating the datasets that will be utilized for the hackathon. Utilizing the Extract-Transform-Load process, we will be extracting data from two sources, transform it into one data set, and bringing the data set to life into a SQL table. Essentially data is cleaned and scrubbed to be turned into something valuable and assist in solving puzzles that businesses often encounter. The importance of data wrangling and refactoring code to perform the ETL process while combining the use of SQL demonstrates the significance of having clean and usable data to assist in solving business problems and questions.
